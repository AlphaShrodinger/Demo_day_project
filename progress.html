            <h3>Step 1: Design</h3>
            <p>We began our journey of designing the game's visuals, layout, and overall aesthetics with simple sketches
                in a notebook. At first, it was all about getting our thoughts down on paperâ€”rough outlines, concepts,
                and ideas. We used this initial stage as a foundation to explore different possibilities, refining the
                style and feel of the game over time. Slowly, we translated these rough ideas into digital designs,
                bringing each concept to life bit by bit. With every step, we saw our vision come together, evolving
                from abstract thoughts into something tangible that truly reflected the essence of the game.</p>

            </div>

            <p>After finalizing the design of our game, we transitioned into the development phase. We chose Godot as
                our game engine, which provided the flexibility and tools we needed to bring our ideas to life. The
                first task was to develop the basic game mechanics and logic. We started simple, focusing on movement.
                We programmed a basic background and created a platform for the character to stand on. From there, we
                implemented movement mechanics, allowing the character to move left and right across the screen. To add
                some complexity, we also coded a double jump feature, marking the first steps toward building out the
                core gameplay.</p>
