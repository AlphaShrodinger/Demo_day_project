            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p> "Dungeons of Stone" is an immersive platformer RPG game developed using the versatile Godot game engine.
                Blending fast-paced platforming with strategic RPG mechanics, the game challenges players to navigate
                intricate dungeons filled with puzzles, traps, and enemies. While there are no custom characters at the
                moment, the game features a robust leveling-up system, allowing players to strengthen their abilities as
                they progress. One unique RPG element is the ability to acquire enemy skillsâ€”players have a rare chance
                to learn and use a skill from defeated foes, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>However, leveling up in "Dungeons of Stone" is deliberately challenging, adding to the overall
                difficulty and rewarding skillful play. This design choice amplifies the game's sense of progression and
                accomplishment. The developers have also hinted at future possibilities, including hidden Easter eggs
                and secret pieces scattered throughout the dungeons, offering players deeper exploration and discovery
                for those willing to seek out these hidden treasures.</p>
