            <h2>About the creators</h2>
            <p>We are a pair of students from a programming school, currently developing a website for a game as part of
                both an academic project and our personal interests. Our passion for game development and programming
                drives us to create a platform that showcases the game’s features, mechanics, and unique design. This
                project allows us to apply the skills we've learned in class, from web development to design principles,
                while also exploring our creativity and love for gaming. It’s an exciting opportunity for us to blend
                learning with a project that’s meaningful to us personally.</p>
        </section>
        <p>At the moment, we are unable to disclose any personal information, as we are still in the development phase
            of both the game and the website. Additionally, we cannot confirm whether the game will be available for
            purchase in the future. Our primary focus right now is on creating an engaging and polished experience, and
            decisions regarding distribution and availability will be made at a later stage.</p>
